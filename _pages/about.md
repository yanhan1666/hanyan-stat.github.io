I am a final year PhD candidate in statistics at Guanghua School of Management of [Peking University](https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/statistic), fortunate to be advised by Professor [Song Xi Chen](http://songxichen.com). 

My research interests lie broadly in statistical inference and machine learning theories, and I am also actively involved in interdisciplinary studies. Some specifics are below:

- Statistical and machine learning 
- Segmented and threshold regression
- Semiparametric and nonparametric statistics
- Transfer learning and causal inference
